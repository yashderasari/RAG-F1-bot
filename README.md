🚀 RAG-F1 Bot: AI-Powered Formula 1 Chatbot
A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that provides real-time Formula 1 insights using OpenAI's GPT models and vector search.

📌 Project Overview
RAG-F1 Bot is an AI-driven chatbot designed to deliver real-time Formula 1 statistics, race updates, and historical insights by integrating LLMs, vector search, and web-based data retrieval. It follows a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, where relevant F1 data is fetched from Wikipedia, Formula 1’s official website, and Sky Sports F1, before passing it through a GPT-4 model to generate highly contextual responses.

⚙️ Technical Implementation
1️⃣ Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline
Document Embeddings: Converts textual F1 data into dense vector representations using OpenAI’s text-embedding-3-small model.
Vector Search: Utilizes Astra DB (powered by DataStax) for high-speed semantic retrieval.
Context Injection: Retrieved documents are dynamically structured into a system prompt before being processed by the GPT model.
LLM Query Optimization: Ensures reduced hallucinations and improved response accuracy by combining retrieval-based context with generative AI.
2️⃣ Backend & AI Integration
OpenAI GPT-4 API: Handles user queries and generates human-like responses.
Streaming AI Responses: Implements OpenAIStream and streamText from Vercel AI SDK to enable real-time streaming of responses, improving interactivity.
Web Scraping & API Integration: Extracts the latest F1 news and statistics from multiple sources to keep the bot up-to-date.
3️⃣ Full-Stack Architecture
Backend: Built using Next.js App Router, with API routes managing data processing and AI interactions.
Database: Astra DB with vector indexing for optimized retrieval of relevant documents.
Frontend UI: Designed with React & TypeScript to provide a seamless chat experience.
Serverless Deployment: Hosted on Vercel, ensuring high availability and low-latency performance.
4️⃣ Performance Optimization & Scalability
Efficient Query Processing: Implements cosine similarity search on vector embeddings for fast context retrieval.
Streaming Responses: Uses server-sent events (SSE) to minimize latency and enhance real-time interaction.
Optimized API Calls: Caches embeddings and uses incremental updates to improve performance.
